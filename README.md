## ðŸ“¸ Sample Predictions

### 1. Gender Classification Output

#### ðŸ”¹ Baseline Model: Basic CNN
The initial model used a simple CNN architecture without addressing class imbalance. As shown below, it performed poorly on female samples due to the imbalanced dataset.

#### ðŸ”¹ Improvements with Oversampling & Focal Loss
To address the imbalance and improve minority class (female) performance, the following techniques were applied:

- **Transfer Learning**: We used pre-trained convolutional backbones (ResNet50, EfficientNetV2, and ConvNeXt) to leverage learned feature representations and improve generalization on our dataset.
- **Oversampling**: Balanced the dataset by oversampling female samples to ensure sufficient representation during training.
- **Focal Loss**: Replaced standard cross-entropy loss with focal loss to focus the model on harder-to-classify samples.  
  - Tuned hyperparameters:  
    - Alpha = 0.89  
    - Gamma = 1.3

These changes significantly improved female accuracy and overall model robustness.

**Models Used:** ResNet50, EfficientNetV2, ConvNeXt (transfer learning).

#### ðŸ”¹ Final Model Results
After applying these methods and fine-tuning, the final model achieved high accuracy on both classes.
